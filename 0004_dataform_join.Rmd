## Load packages/libraries

Use `library()` to load packages at the top of each R script.

```{r loading packages, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse); library(data.table); library(dtplyr)
```

## Wide vs. long data (messy vs. tidy data)

Manually create wide data

```{r}
wide <- data_frame(student = c("Andy", "Mary"),
                   englishGrades = c(1, -2),
                   mathGrades = englishGrades * 10,
                   physicsGrades = mathGrades * 100)
wide
```

Manually create equivalent long data

```{r}
long <- data_frame(student = rep(c("Andy", "Mary"), each = 3),
                   class = rep(c("englishGrades", "mathGrades", "physicsGrades"), times = 2),
                   grades = c(1, 10, 1000, -2, -20, -2000))
long
```

Compare wide vs long

```{r}
wide # wide
```

```{r}
long # long
```

## Wide to long with `melt()` (from `data.table`)

There is a base R `melt()` function that is less powerful and slower than the `melt()` that comes with `data.table`. As long as you've loaded `data.table` with `library(data.table)`, you'll be using the more powerful version of `melt()`.

```{r}
melt(wide, id.vars = c("student"))
```

Rename variables

```{r}
melt(wide, id.vars = c("student"), variable.name = "cLaSs", value.name = "gRaDeS") 
```

Compare with the long form we created

```{r}
melt(wide, id.vars = c("student"), variable.name = "cLaSs", value.name = "gRaDeS") %>% 
    arrange(student, cLaSs)
```

```{r}
long
```

## Wide to long with `gather()` (from `tidyverse` and `tidyr`)

`gather()` is less flexible than `melt()`

```{r}
gather(wide, key = cLaSs, value = gRaDeS, -student) # remove the id column
```

## Long to wide with `dcast()` (from `data.table`)

There is a base R `dcast()` function that is less powerful and slower than the `dcast()` that comes with `data.table`. As long as you've loaded `data.table` with `library(data.table)`, you'll be using the more powerful version of `dcast()`.

* left-side of formula ~: id variables (can be more than 1)
* right-wide of formula ~: columns/variables to split by (can be more than 1)
* value.var: which column has the values (can be more than 1)

```{r}
dcast(long, student ~ class, value.var = "grades")
```

```{r}
wide # compare with dcast() output
```

## Long to wide with `spread()` (from `tidyverse` and `tidyr`)

`spread()` is less flexible than `dcast()`

```{r}
spread(long, key = class, value = grades)
```

```{r}
wide # compare with spread() output
```

## Joining/binding data (rows)

```{r}
wide # original data
```

```{r}
moreRows <- data_frame(student = c("John", "Jane"),
                       englishGrades = c(5, -5),
                       mathGrades = englishGrades * 10,
                       physicsGrades = mathGrades * NA)
moreRows
```

```{r}
rbind(wide, moreRows)
```

```{r}
bind_rows(wide, moreRows)
```

`bind_rows` has same effect as rbind() above, but much more efficient/flexible and binds even if column numbers don't match (see below).

```{r}
moreRows2 <- data_frame(student = c("John", "Jane"),
                       englishGrades = c(5, -5),
                       mathGrades = englishGrades * 10)
moreRows2
```

```{r}
wide
moreRows2 # one less column
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
rbind(wide, moreRows2) # error
```

```{r}
bind_rows(wide, moreRows2) # no error but fills with NA
```

## Joining/binding data (columns)

Same with `rbind()`, you can use `cbind()` to join data by columns. And `bind_cols()` is much more efficient and flexible. 

```{r}
wide2 <- bind_rows(wide, moreRows2)
wide2
```

```{r}
columnsToBind <- data_frame(extraCol = c(999, NA, 999, NA))
columnsToBind
```

```{r}
bind_cols(wide2, columnsToBind)
```

## Joining data with `left_join()` (from `tidyverse`)

Type `?left_join()` in your console to see all other types of joins. I use `left_join()` most frequently.

Look at the data below. What if we have some information about each student in a separate dataframe and we want to merge the datasets?

```{r}
wide2
```

Let's say we know the gender and chemistry grades of each student...

```{r}
extraInfo <- data_frame(student = c("Jane", "John", "Mary", "Andy"),
                        chemistryGrades = c(900, 901, 902, 903))
extraInfo
```

Can we merge the data `wide2` and `extraInfo` with `bind_cols()`?

```{r}
bind_cols(wide2, extraInfo)
```

What's wrong? How to fix it?

```{r}
left_join(wide2, extraInfo)
```

Is the output what you expect? Is it correct? What does the 'Joining, by = "student"' mean?

What if we have missing/incomplete extra information?

```{r}
extraInfo2 <- data_frame(student = c("Jane", "John"),
                        chemistryGrades = c(900, 901))
extraInfo2
```

```{r}
left_join(wide2, extraInfo2)
```

Works! Rows with missing information have `NA`.

Note that you can specify which columns/variables to join by via the `by` parameter in all join functions. By default, R automatically finds matching column/variable names between both data objects and joins by ALL matching columns/variables.

Also, the output class of join functions are not `data.table`! To convert class, use pipes!

```{r}
class(left_join(wide2, extraInfo2)) # not data.table (no...)
left_join(wide2, extraInfo2) %>% tbl_dt() # convert to data.table
left_join(wide2, extraInfo2) %>% tbl_dt() %>% class() # check class (data.table! yea!)
```

## Within-subjects, between-subjects designs, covariates

Create some data

```{r}
gradesWide <- left_join(wide2, extraInfo2)
gradesWide
```

Wide form data is good for dependent/paired t.tests in R (within-subjects)

```{r}
t.test(gradesWide$englishGrades, gradesWide$mathGrades, paired = T)
t.test(gradesWide$englishGrades, gradesWide$chemistryGrades, paired = T)
```

But long-form data is generally preferred

```{r}
gradesLong <- melt(gradesWide, id.vars = "student", variable.name = "class", value.name = "grade") %>% 
    arrange(student) %>% # sort by student
    tbl_dt() # convert to data.table and tibble
gradesLong
```

What if we want to use `englishGrades` as a covariate? Then the covariate has to be in a separate column/variable.

Subset data with just covariate and id variable

```{r}
covariate_englishGrades <- gradesLong[class == "englishGrades", .(student, grade)]
covariate_englishGrades
```

Rename covariate 

```{r}
setnames(covariate_englishGrades, "grade", "englishGrades")
covariate_englishGrades
```

Use `left_join()` to add covariate to data

```{r}
gradesLong_covariate <- left_join(gradesLong, covariate_englishGrades)
gradesLong_covariate

# remove englishGrades from long form data if necessary
gradesLong_covariate2 <- gradesLong_covariate[class != "englishGrades"] 
gradesLong_covariate2
```

Fit model with covariate using `lm()` (linear model)

```{r}
summary(lm(grade ~ class + englishGrades, data = gradesLong_covariate2))
```

Get ANOVA output from `lm()` output

```{r}
summary.aov(lm(grade ~ class + englishGrades, data = gradesLong_covariate2))
```

```{r}
anova(lm(grade ~ class + englishGrades, data = gradesLong_covariate2))
```

Fit model with covariate using `aov()` (ANOVA)

```{r}
summary(aov(grade ~ class + englishGrades, data = gradesLong_covariate2))
```
