## What is this site about? 

This site contains beginner R tutorials as well as relatively advanced data analysis tips/tricks I have used to analyze experimental psychology data. Occasionally, I'll also explain statistical procedures and concepts in R. I have used these tutorials and articles to teach data science with R in graduate school. In my tutorials and articles, I usually try my best to explain *how* things work rather than just provide the uncommented code. 

* tutorials: beginner R tutorials ([R programming basics](0001_rbasics.html), [tidyverse, data.table](0002_tidyverse_datatable.html), etc.)
* [articles](articles.html): more advanced data analysis tips/tricks and statistical concepts illustrated in R

## Where to begin?

If you're new to R, start with the tutorials. If you're looking for tips/tricks to improve your existing R workflow, check out my [articles](https://hausetutorials.netlify.com/articles.html).

## More resources?

* [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/): mostly R and Python tutorials
* my [hausekeep R package](https://hauselin.github.io/hausekeep/): contains functions for experimental psychological research
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): contains many packages (e.g., dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, stringr)
    * manipulate dataframes (and tibbles) easily with tidyr, dplyr; make beautiful plots with clean syntax (ggplot2)
* [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
    * powerful, extremely fast, and simple way to manipulate dataframes/datatables
